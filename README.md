# JavaMind

I made this simple command-line game for a workshop for high-schoolers with no coding experience to enable a quick success when first getting to know Java.

- Very stripped-down single-player clone of Mastermind, the color guessing game.
- A three-digit sequence is generated by the computer at random.
- The player has up to 10 tries for guessing the sequence.
- After each guess, the player is told how many digits were correct.
- There are 3 colors: red (r), green (g) and blue (b).

I know this code isn't particularly beautiful or robust to any unexpected behavior. It's meant to be easy to understand for people with no coding experience and therefore makes some tradeoffs.
